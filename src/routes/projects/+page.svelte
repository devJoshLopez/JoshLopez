    <!-- Quantum's Curse - book -->
    <!-- Working on this. No link currently. -->
    <!-- blurb: David Wells is a struggling visionary physicist who has dedicated his life to developing a revolutionary teleportation technology. But when the government and ambitious venture capitalist Reed Adams offer funding in exchange for control over his research, David finds himself caught in a dangerous Faustian bargain.
Despite escalating ethical concerns, David accepts Reed's deal, hoping to finally validate his unconventional theories. However, Reed has no interest in altruistic applications - he demands David rapidly weaponize the unstable teleportation tech.
When David resists, Reed turns ruthless, determined to retain dominion over the technology he believes will cement America's global dominance. After David takes drastic measures to prevent Reed's militarization plans, the venture capitalist unleashes his full arsenal of coercion, turning David into a wanted fugitive.
To redeem his disastrous mistakes and prevent catastrophic misuse, David must evade capture long enough to reveal Reed's web of deceit. With the help of allies, he races against time to expose the truth in a battle against unchecked ambition.
Quantum's Curse is a high-stakes thriller asking how principles survive in the face of pressures to compromise integrity for influence and control. David's inner journey illuminates dilemmas of balancing ethics and discovery, ambition and conscience. -->
