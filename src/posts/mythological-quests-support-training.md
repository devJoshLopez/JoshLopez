Hey there, tech adventurers! Today, I'm excited to share a behind-the-scenes look at how I'm adding a dash of mythology and a sprinkle of fun to our customer support training. Buckle up, because we're about to embark on an epic journey through the realm of support hero training!

### The Genesis of Our Mythological Missions

Picture this: you're in a team meeting, and instead of hearing "We're starting a new training module," you hear "Your next mission, should you choose to accept it, is Project Pegasus." Sounds more exciting, right?

That's exactly what I was aiming for when I started theming our monthly training projects around mythology. I wanted our team to feel like they were part of something epic – think James Bond or Charlie's Angels, but for customer support.

> "I just completed Project Pegasus and it was a doozy!"

Imagine telling your friends and family that instead of "I finished my work training." It's this excitement and sense of adventure that I wanted to bring to our team's learning experience.

### How Our Quests Work

Each month, I craft a new training project that combines three Memberstack features. These aren't randomly chosen – I keep an eye on what customers are struggling with, chat with the company about what needs testing, and sprinkle in some fun features too. It's all about finding that perfect balance of practical learning and enjoyment.

Our support heroes get an extra 4 hours each month to work on these projects. It's like a mini-hackathon, but with a mythological twist!

### The Epic Outcomes

Now, you might be wondering, "Does this actually work?" Well, let me share some of the awesome outcomes we've seen:

1. **Bug Busting**: Our team has uncovered outdated documentation and sneaky bugs that might have otherwise slipped through the cracks. They're like the Hercules of our product, cleaning out those pesky Augean stables!

2. **Team Bonding**: As a fully remote team, these projects have become a great way for everyone to bond. It's like we're all part of the same adventuring party, tackling quests together.

3. **Keeping Skills Sharp**: With Memberstack evolving faster than Proteus changes shape, these projects ensure our team stays up-to-date with all our features.

4. **Empathy Boost**: By walking in our customers' shoes (or sandals, if we're sticking with the mythology theme), our team gains a deeper understanding of user experiences and challenges.

5. **Unexpected Collaboration**: I've seen more teamwork and idea-sharing than I initially expected. It's like watching the Argonauts come together to sail the Argo!

### A Peek into Our Mythological Training Realm

Let me give you a glimpse of some of the epic quests our team has embarked on:

#### Project Pegasus (February 2024)

**Theme**: Soaring to new heights of customer understanding.
**Features**: User account creation, secure payments, content gating.
**Quest**: Build a site for a fitness instructor with live classes and pre-recorded workouts.

#### Project Odyssey (March 2024)

**Theme**: Navigating the seas of social interaction.
**Features**: Social logins, secure hosted content, dynamic commenting systems.
**Quest**: Create a community platform, educational portal, or event platform.

One of our support heroes shared their experience:

> "I integrated a community discussion feature and discovered that some commenting components auto-focus on page load. It's insights like these that help us improve user experience!"

#### Project Atlas (April 2024)

**Theme**: Bearing the weight of complex integrations.
**Features**: Member JSON Data, Cross Domain Logins, Automation (webhooks, Zapier, Make.com).
**Quest**: Develop an e-book platform, newsletter, charity platform, or job board.

Another team member's discovery:

> "I gained new insights into the Make platform, enhancing my skills in automation and workflow integration. Thanks, Josh, for the guidance!"

### Overcoming Challenges: It's Not All Ambrosia and Nectar

Like any hero's journey, we've faced our share of challenges. Initially, explaining the concept was as tricky as describing Daedalus' labyrinth. But once we put it into practice, the team quickly caught on to the excitement.

Balancing the difficulty for both newbies and seasoned team members is an ongoing quest. It's like setting up a D&D campaign – you want everyone to feel challenged but not overwhelmed. Sometimes it means extra prep work, like creating dummy data for migration projects, but seeing the team's engagement makes it all worthwhile.

### The Support Strategy Puzzle: Where Training Fits In

These mythological quests aren't just for fun (although they are that too!). They're a crucial piece of our support strategy puzzle. In a fast-paced environment like ours, staying updated is as important as Achilles' heel was to him. These projects keep our team agile and ready to tackle any customer query that comes their way.

### Tips for Fellow Support Leaders

Thinking of trying something similar? Here's my advice:

1. **Focus on Fun**: Don't get too caught up in metrics. The goal is to keep your team engaged and learning.
2. **Encourage Sharing**: Create opportunities for your team to share their experiences and learnings.
3. **Be Flexible**: What works for us might need tweaking for your team. Be open to adjusting as you go.
4. **Think Thematically**: Mythology works for us, but maybe your team would prefer a sci-fi theme or detective mysteries. The key is finding what resonates.

### What's Next on Our Heroic Journey?

As for the future, I'm always open to suggestions! Who knows, maybe our next quest will involve AI-powered oracles or time-traveling customer tickets. The sky's the limit when you've got imagination and a willingness to try new things.

### Wrapping Up: The Ongoing Odyssey

Remember, at the end of the day, support is about people helping people. These mythological quests are our way of keeping the human element front and center, all while leveling up our skills and having a bit of fun.

So, fellow support leaders, I challenge you: How can you add a dash of excitement to your team's training? Whether it's mythological quests or something entirely different, find what makes your team's eyes light up with that "I can't wait to try this" spark.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! Have you tried any unique training methods with your team? What challenges do you face in keeping remote teams engaged and up-to-date? Let's continue this epic discussion in the comments below!\_
