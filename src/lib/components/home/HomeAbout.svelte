  <p class="mb-4">👋 Hey there, digital ally!</p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    That's me up there, sporting a tee and hoodie because why get fancy when
    you're wrangling JavaScript and decoding user enigmas? 👕💻
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    I'm Josh, and I'm rewiring the internet to feel less like SkyNet and more
    like your neighborhood arcade. 🕹️🌟

    At Memberstack, I'm a digital Swiss Army knife. One moment, I'm crafting
    modals that guide users like friendly game tutorials. The next, I'm leveling
    up our AI, Rey, to offer wisdom as reliable as a GameShark. Between quests,
    I'm scribing help docs that turn "Game Over" screens into "New High Score!"
    moments. 🚀📚🔧

  <p class="mb-4">
    But my favorite power-up? Leading our Guild of Support Heroes. We don't just
    troubleshoot; we turn rage-quits into standing ovations. Every ticket is a
    boss battle, and we don't rest until our users are dancing like they just
    saved Princess Toadstool. 🍄🎉

    Off the clock, you'll find me in Big Sky Country (Montana), my own personal
    Hoth base, plotting benevolent world-changes from my local cinema throne.
    The 80s and 90s aren't just history; they're my OS. 🌄🎬

    This site? It's my DeLorean, my phone booth that's bigger on the inside, my hot tub time machine. Here,
    I share:

    <li class="mb-2">💡 Code sagas & customer success fables</li>
    <li class="mb-2">🎨 Projects proving beautiful code isn't a myth</li>
    <li class="mb-2">🎬 Essays on why "Hackers" is the WOPR of movies</li>

    I believe the best tech is like Miyazaki's magic—it feels warm, looks beautiful, and puts humans first. Every function, every tutorial, every popcorn-fueled analogy here is a brushstroke in that masterpiece.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    So, whether you're untangling spaghetti code, reciting "Short Circuit" for
    the 256th time (binary humor!), or hunting for tech that sparks joy, grab a
    beanbag. Shell is optional, but rad is mandatory.

  <p class="mb-4">
    Together, let's npm-install a future that's as epic as our mixtapes. 💾🎶
