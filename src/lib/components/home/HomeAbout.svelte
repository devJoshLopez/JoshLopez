    <p class="mb-4">👋 Hey there, digital ally!</p>
  
    <p class="mb-4">
      That's me up there, sporting a tee and hoodie because why get fancy when
      you're wrangling JavaScript and decoding user enigmas? 👕💻

      I'm Josh, and I'm rewiring the internet to feel less like SkyNet and more
      like your neighborhood arcade. 🕹️🌟

      At Memberstack, I'm a digital MacGyver. One moment, I'm architecting modals
      that guide users like friendly NPCs. The next, I'm upgrading our AI, Rey, to
      dispense wisdom with the accuracy of a cheat code. When I'm not immersed in
      these side quests, I'm authoring lore scrolls (help docs) that turn "Game
      Over" moments into "New High Score!" epiphanies. 🚀📚🔧

      But my favorite power-up? Leading our Guild of Support Heroes. We don't just
      troubleshoot; we turn rage-quits into standing ovations. Every ticket is a
      boss battle, and we don't rest until our users are dancing like they just
      saved Princess Toadstool. 🍄🎉

      Off the clock, you'll find me in Big Sky Country (Montana), my own personal
      Hoth base, plotting benevolent world-changes from my local cinema throne.
      The 80s and 90s aren't just history; they're my OS. 🌄🎬

      This site? It's my DeLorean, my phone booth, my hot tub time machine. Here,
      I share:

      I believe the best tech is indistinguishable from magic—but the Gandalf
      kind, not the "you shall not pass" firewall kind. Every function, every
      tutorial, every movie quote here is a step towards that Shire.

    <p class="mb-4">
      So, whether you're untangling spaghetti code, reciting "Short Circuit" for
      the 256th time (binary humor!), or hunting for tech that sparks joy, grab a
      beanbag. Shell is optional, but rad is mandatory.
